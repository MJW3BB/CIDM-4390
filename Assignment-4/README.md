# Assignment Four - User Stories
### Description

In preparation for your team work in this class, let's re-examine the code club project so that you can engage in agile/scrum planning.

The task is relatively simple. You will create all of the Product Backlog Items in Azure DevOps (visualstudio.com) for the coding club app.

### Recall that all Product Backlog Items have at least the following:

* User stories
* Acceptance Criteria

### User Stories

For all features and functions of the program you fill create a user story. You'll use this template:

As a _________________ (role)
I want/need ______________________ (feature)
So that ______________________ (goal/capability)
For all user stories, you'll need to articulate acceptance criteria so that you'll know you're "done" and that what you've done is correct. You'll use this template:

Given ___________________ (condition or prerequisite)
When ___________________ (describe the interaction or state change)
Then ____________________ (what are the intended results? Think of "should")

In the earliest scrum and xP teams, it was common to put such information on an index card, like so:

### However, 

we'll place our stories and acceptance criteria into VSTS.

From the article, you'll see something like this:
