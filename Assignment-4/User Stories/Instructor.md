# Instructor

1. As a Instructor (role)
2. I want/need to create my own profile AND create new skills and competencies that can be used by Student (feature)
3. So that I can create new skills and competencies that I teach (goal/capability)

### For all user stories, you'll need to articulate acceptance criteria so that you'll know you're "done" and that what you've done is correct. You'll use this template:

1. Given that I can specify my account as a professor (condition or prerequisite)
2. When I register as an instructor and specify my university and courses I teach and tag their associated skills and competencies (describe the interaction or state change)
3. Then I  will be able to control my profile appearance and create new skills and competencies(what are the intended results? Think of "should")

## Gherkin Notation
