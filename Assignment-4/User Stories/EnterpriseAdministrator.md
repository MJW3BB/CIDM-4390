# Enterprise Admin

1. As a Enterprise Administrator (role)
2. I want/need to manage the content of the website (feature)
3. So that I can act as a administrator (goal/capability)

### For all user stories, you'll need to articulate acceptance criteria so that you'll know you're "done" and that what you've done is correct. You'll use this template:

1. Given the enterprise administrator account is marked as an enterprise administrator (condition or prerequisite)
2. When I login (describe the interaction or state change)
3. Then administrator will be routed to a page that allows for management of site content (what are the intended results? Think of "should")

## Gherkin Notation

Feature: CRUD all site content, including databases, users, and any other aspect of the site
    - In order to moderate and manage the website
    - Administrators should be able to
    - CRUD user content, site data or user accounts.
