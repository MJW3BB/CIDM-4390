# Business

1. As a Business (role)
2. I want/need to create my own profile page and create a list or "build" of desired skills/competencies (feature)
3. So that I can showcase my business and acquire new employees with desired skills/competencies (goal/capability)

### For all user stories, you'll need to articulate acceptance criteria so that you'll know you're "done" and that what you've done is correct. You'll use this template:

1. Given I can create a profile (condition or prerequisite)
2. When I add different skills/competencies to the site (describe the interaction or state change)
3. Then I should have a list of what skills/competencies my business needs and what job postings require (what are the intended results? Think of "should")

## Gherkin Notation
