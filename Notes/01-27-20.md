# CIDM-4390 Notes
## Jan 27, 2020

### The Microsoft Docs tutorials are not meant to be a simple do and submit, they are all about taking your time and learning how these methodologies work

### If you have any latework, you should be able to submit it by the end of today or tomorrow without too much penalty

## Teams
 * 3 Teams (Consisting of a SCRUM Master, DevOps, and someone that under performs)

## Notes
 * The goals of the microsoft docs is to have you create an app, however the final product of this course will be the sum of multiple applications that work together
 * The purpose of agile is to have different or re-useable "bricks" so to speak
 * ASPX - Front Facing
 * .cs files - Controller
 * [UI Development tools that the cool kids use](https://www.figma.com/)

## Lets have you do something
* A dependency is a relationship between two distinct entities where on cannot perform their function without the other
* (A) Client --> Depends On --> (B) Service

### Start a new project folder
```
mkdir MyLibrary
```
```
mkdir MyApp
```
```
cd MyLibrary
```
```
dotnet new classlib
```
```
Now rename Class1.cs to MathRoutines.cs
```
### Code along, YAY!
By creating a Class Library, you can create code that performs a function and then you can call it in other applications, hence the name "library" of code or routines that perform a specific function to modify data.

### You've created a classlibrary, now call it in another application
* Switch to MyApp and create a new console app
```
cd ..
```
```
cd MyApp/
```
```
dotnet new console
```
* When you call your mathroutines class library, it gets built in the form of a .dll (Dynamically Linked Library)
* You have to run a build to generate a .dll for your classlibrary
```
cd ..
```
```
cd MyLibrary/
```
```
dotnet build
```
* The .dll for your mathroutined should be located in bin folder
### If you look at a game folder or windows/system32, they all run of .dll's 
### Everythin uses .dll's
## Class Library Services are part of your final application in this course, they are also a part of any modern application!
This will allow teammates to have seperated work so none will step on your toes
* Go back to the root of your project folder
* To build a solution file or sln
```
dotnet new sln
```
Open the sln file
### DO NOT MANUALLY EDIT THE SLN FILE
```
dotnet sln // shows cli options
```
```
dotnet sln add ./MyApp/MyApp.csproj
```
```
dotnet sln add ./MyLibrary/MyLibrary.csproj
```
```
dotnet build
```
the add method inside the class library doesnt know about the app and vice versa, we need to make sure these can talk to each other.
```
dotnet add // allows you to either reference projects or packages
```
Navigate to your MyApp folder to add the reference
```
dotnet add reference ../MyLibrary/MyLibrary.csproj
```
Now add the using statement to your C# Class that will call it in
```
using MyLibrary;
```

### This is pretty much your deployment strategy for business rules, logic, and standard coding processes. Data deployment will be different

## SCRUM
 * [SCRUM Guide](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html)
 * The SCRUM Master will be a legit choice, a superstar in the class.
 * Value realized in sprints

 To enhance communication, using gherkin notation or syntax will also be expected
 * [Gherkin Notation/Syntax](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/)

 Specify
 Measure (Gestimate)
 Order

Identify a sprint goal so that when you get into the thick of things you can still remember what the main objective is.
