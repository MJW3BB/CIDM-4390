- Leaders leave the room while soldiers view this briefing 
- The issues with informal communities like stack overflow and reddit are that there is no formal regulation
- The point of ACM and IEEE is to regulate and control information in a formal method
### Your curriculum in this course corresponds with the CC2005 sub categories
- CC2001 = Computer Science
- IS2002 = Information System
- SE2004 = Software Engineering
- CE2004 = Computer Engineering 
- IT2006 - Information Technology
All of these provide a foundation in computing
### Pre-1990s
- Hardware = EE+, CE
- Software = CS
- Business = IS
### Post-1990s
- Hardware = EE, CE
- Software = CE, CS, SE
- Organizational Needs = IT, IS
### Pervasive and Ubiquitous 
- Programming, Networking, Database, Design all combine to knowledge units such as data visualization 
- Normalization covers learning outcomes that can be expected
- Understanding how an application works on a design and micro perspective versus a "how it works" outcomes specifies the difference between those who design and those who implement
### You do not need to understand how the algebra of a database works in order to use one
Different levels of understanding do necessarily imply an ability to implement or use certain technologies 
Refer to Blooms Taxonomy

- The internet can replace the knowledge block, as it has become mankinds knowledge base
- Learning outcomes have level

### Write a SQL query to get seniors taking 4390, output as first and last name. Table is called CIS majors
SELECT * fname, lname FROM CISMAJORS WHERE CLASSIFICATION = 'SENIOR' AND CIDM4390=TRUE

## If it can be computed it can be automated
- If you can position yourself as the middleman between the needs of business and machines, you will have a career in implementing those technologies

CDKST = , Disposition, Knowledge, Skill, Task

### Papers to look at
- http://proc.iscap.info/2019/authors.html (Papers 4955, 4962 from Babb) [Contains the fodder you need to use on Appendix E 4955]
- https://www.cc2020.net/ - how to build a pizza
- Just as malls are dying due to amazon, aspects of universities are dying due to informal learning platforms such as stack overflow, youtube videos, etc...
- How do you compare program A to program B? (Program meaning degree)

## Professor Leslie Waguespack will be your client for this project
- The scope will most likely be larger than what you accomplish, that is normal and OK

## Things to expect/ DO THIS ASAFP!
- Your self ratings are the basis of team selection
- Your team will need to choose a SCRUM master (nucleus or leader)
- Stand up an authouritative/central repository (Bitbucket or Github, or Azure DevOps)
- Somebody needs to create the authouritative/central Azure DevOps team (Max 5 ppl)
- NOTE: You are being personally evaluated, not just your team. The only person evaluating anybody is Babb, the team lead will only be giving you advice on what to focus on.
- Only ONE person needs to stand up a VPS (Digital Ocean, or a STRONG reason for something else) Split it among other students (GET THE BACKUP)
- https://www.digitalocean.com/
    1. Make a droplet for 5$
    2. Ubuntu 18.04.03
    3. No SSH keys, do not add anything
    4. One Time Password
    5. Back it up
- Product backlog - determine what extra questions to ask babb (the client)
START ON THE 4 THINGS on WEDNESDAY!!

My Team is Haley, Dubbs, and me
